#### Exercises
_(To be performed on your own Kali and Ubuntu lab client machines - Reporting is not required for these exercises)_

**1.  Identify your public IP address. Using public information sources, see what you can learn about your IP address. If you don't find anything on your specific IP address, try the class C it is a part of.**



**2.  Compare what information you can gather about your home IP address to one gathered for your work IP address. Think about how an attacker could use the discovered information as part of an attack.**



**3.  Download the _Fingerprint2_ library and craft a web page similar to the one shown in the [Client Fingerprinting] section. Browse the web page from your Windows 10 lab machine and repeat the steps in order to collect the information extracted by the JavaScript library on your Kali web server.**
