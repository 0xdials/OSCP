# acquisitions
#### crunchbase
- start with newest first
- be sure all domains are within scope
# asn enumeration
#### bgp.he.net
- autonomous system numbers are given to large enough networks
- these ASNs help track down sembiance of an entitys IT structure
- most reliable way is manually, using hurrican electrics free form search (link above)
- cloud infrastructure can hide network elements
- search term and results will include IP ranges
- search for main target plus any acquisitions

# amass scan
- OWASP amass: takes ASN and will return any domains
`amass intel --asn <asn_here>`
- map seeds to freemind with subdomains under main seed

# reverse whois
#### whoxy.com (paid/cheap api)
#### DOMLink to automate

# ad/analytics relationships
#### builtwith.com
- used to track any ad or analytics tracking codes
- useful for correlating new seeds/roots 

#### getrelationship.py
- cmd alternative
- could be used for automation

- could also google copyright, terms, privacy text


# linked discovery/subdomain enumeration
#### burp, hakrawler, gospider, subdomainizer
- spider domain in burp pro (ZAP is free? need to look into)
- linked discovery can be done with gospider or hakrawler 
- finding a new seed means you would have to run the spidering tools again
- subdomainizer can take list of JS links and parse for domains (burp extension can parse JS for endpoints)
- use burp or hakrawler to find list of JS files

# subdomain scraping
## github dorking
- use gh_dorked.py to create GH urls to search outside of company's page
- use github-dork.py to search via github api for internal 
- probably be doing GH dorking during other subdomain steps
- see: @th3g3ntleman - github and sensitive data exposure
#### github-subdomains.py
- https://github.com/gwen001/github-search/blob/master/github-subdomains.py <- main script
- https://github.com/gwen001/github-search <- a ton of useful stuff
#### amass
-  https://github.com/OWASP/Amass
`amass enum -d <DOMAIN>`
- sub bruteforcing:
`amass enum -brute -d <DOAMIN> -src`
or specify resolvers
`amass enum -brute -d <DOAMIN> -rf RESOLVERS.TXT -w BRUTEFORCE.LIST`
#### shuffledns
- another tool for bruteforcing subdomains
#### subfinder
- https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder
#### subdomainizer
- tools for analyzing JS to find subdomains, cloud services, or sesitive items
#### subscraper
- tool for recursively searching JS files for subdomains
#### shodubgo
- shodan subdomain parser
- https://github.com/incogbyte/shosubgo
#### cloud ranges
- blod outlining SSL recon https://www.daehee.com/scan-aws-ip-ssl-certificates/
- Sam Erb talk on hunting certificates -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pqCqz3JzXE
	- https://tls.bufferover.run/dns?q=QUERY
## wordlists for scraping
- all.txt - GIANT wordlist, used as catch-all
- TomNomNom - talk on how to create bespoked wordlist for a given target
- theres a tool for this somewhere, will update when found
## alteration scanning
- scanining multiple permutations of similar dns names (dev.company.com, dev1.company.com, dev2.company.com)
- altdns - early tool for alteration scanning
- amass also includes options for this

# port analysis
- masscan time
`masscan -p1-65535 -iL INPUTFILE --max-rate 1800 -oG OUTPUTFILE`
- only works on ip lists, cannot do domains
- dnmasscan - wrapper for masscan which can resolve domains

# service scanning/brutespraying
- feed found ports from previous step to nmap
- use tool called brutespray to scan admin protocols with default creds (uses nmap outfile -oG)
