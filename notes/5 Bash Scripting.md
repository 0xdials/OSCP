Write a short Bash script to perform a ping sweep of a target IP address range. This script will only print the IP addresses of any valid responses (one IP address per line) and nothing else. To make this script more broadly applicable, you will not hardcode the IP address range. Instead, this script will require three arguments: the first three octets of the IP address, the starting value of the last octet, and the ending value of the last octet (see below for examples). You DO NOT need to do any error checking (but feel free to do so). Upload your script to the Kali VM #8 student's home folder and run _/challenge/ping-sweep_ with your script's location as the first argument to get the flag.
