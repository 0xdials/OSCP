# 15.1.4 Cross-Compiling Exploit Code
**1.  Locate the exploit discussed in this section using the searchsploit tool in Kali Linux.**

We simply need to run the following command in order to find our exploit:
`searchsploit "Sync Breeze Enterprise 10.0.28"`

We can then copy the exploit to our working directory by using the -m command:
`searchsploit -m 42341`

**2.  Install the mingw-w64 suite in Kali Linux and compile the exploit code.**

In order to install mingw-w64 we need to run the following command:
`sudo apt install mingw-w64`

Upon viewing the code we see a few headers are included
```#include <inttypes.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <winsock2.h>
#include <windows.h>
```

Doing a bit of research on winsock informs us that adding the lws2_32 flag should allow us to compile the program on our Kali machine. The following command will compile the code:
`i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 42341.c -o syncbreeze_exploit.exe -lws2_32`

# 15.1.6 Changing the Socket Information
**1.  Modify the connection information in the exploit in order to target the SyncBreeze installation on your Windows client.**



**2.  Recompile the exploit and use Wireshark to confirm that the code successfully initiates a socket connection to your dedicated Windows client.**


# 15.1.8 Changing the Return Address
**1.  Find any valid return address instruction and alter the one present in the original exploit.**


# 15.1.10 Changing the Payload
**1.  Generate a reverse shell payload using msfvenom while taking into account the bad characters of our exploit.**
**2.  Replace the original payload with the newly generated one.**
**3.  Attach the debugger to the target process and set a breakpoint at the return address instruction.**
**4.  Compile the exploit and run it. Did you hit the breakpoint?**


# 15.1.12 Changing the Overflow Buffer
**1.  Fix the overflow buffer such that the EIP register will be overwritten by your chosen return address instruction.**
**2.  Install the _ASX to MP3 Converter_ application located under the C:\Tools\fixing_exploits directory; download the exploit for _ASX to MP3 Converter_ from EDB[1](https://portal.offensive-security.com/courses/pen-200/books-and-videos/modal/modules/fixing-exploits/fixing-memory-corruption-exploits/practice-changing-the-overflow-buffer#fn1) and edit it in order to get a shell on your dedicated Windows machine.**


# 15.2.4 Changing Connectivity Information
**1.  Connect to your dedicated Linux lab client and start the apache2 service; the target web application is located under /var/www/https/.**
**2.  Modify the original exploit and set the _base_url_ variable to the correct IP address of your dedicated Linux lab client as well as the protocol to HTTPS.**
**3.  Get familiar with the _requests_ Python library and adjust your exploit accordingly to avoid SSL verification.**
**4.  Edit the _username_ and _password_ variables to match the ones from our test case (username "admin", password "HUYfaw763").**
**5.  Try to run the exploit against the Linux lab client, does it work? If not, try to explain why.**


# 15.2.6 Troubleshooting the "index out of range" Error
**1.  Observe the error that is generated when running the exploit.**
**2.  Attempt to troubleshoot the code and determine why the error occurs.**
**3.  Modify the exploit in order to avoid the error and run it against your dedicated Linux client.**
**4.  Verify that your exploit worked by attempting to execute the _whoami_ command using the remote php shell.**
**5.  Attempt to obtain a fully interactive shell with this exploit.**
